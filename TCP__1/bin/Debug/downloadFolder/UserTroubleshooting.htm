I get an Access Denied error when trying to browse to the /incoming or /outgoing 
folders</a></h4>
<p class="style1">This issue applied only to Anonymous file transfers.&nbsp; All 
&quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; folders do not allow directory listing of files for 
security measures. When trying to list files from these folder, an access denied 
error is expected. Most FTP client GUI tools will automatically try to list 
files when you traverse a file structure regardless of whether you want to see 
files in the folders or not. When prompted due to the errors, just click through 
the error and then try your file transfer.&nbsp; You may also see these Access 
Denied or Directory Listing Denied errors in the FTP Client log that can be 
ignored.</p>
<p class="style1">For example, you may see the error when browsing to the 
/outgoing folder to upload a file within the Internet Explorer web browse (also 
applies to /incoming folder):<br />

</a></span>
<h4 class="style1">
<a name="Microsoft_Windows_FTP_Program_(FTP.exe)_is_not_working">Microsoft 
Windows FTP Program (FTP.exe) is not working</a></h4>
<p class="style1">Windows FTP program (sometimes referred to as FTP.exe) is not 
supported due to its inability to support a feature called passive data 
connections. You will need to find an FTP program that does support passive data 
connections.&nbsp; A <a href="ExternalUserGuides.htm">guide for users outside of 
Intel&#39;s networks</a> and a <a href="IntelUserGuides.htm">guide for users 
connected inside of Intel</a> may be helpful; however, there are other FTP clients 
other than those mentioned in the guides that 
support passive data connections are available. </p>
<span class="style1"><a name="Performance_is_slow"></a></span>
<h4 class="style1"><a name="Performance_is_slow2">Performance is slow</a></h4>
<p class="style1">Tips to gain higher performance are: </p>
<ol>
				<li class="style1">Use FTP over Explicit TLS/SSL connections.&nbsp; 
				In some unique situations cases, this transfer method can be 
				faster.</li>
				<li class="style1">The Internet will likely have the greatest 
				impact on performance. In general, higher the bandwidth/speed of 
				Internet connection will increase performance. </li>
				<li class="style1">Network latency can increase transfer times 
				and this service is hosted in California, US; therefore, it is 
				likely that transferring files within the US will be faster than 
				transferring files outside of the US. Transferring files from 
				other US sites outside of California may also be slower. </li>
				<li class="style1">Transferring files on off-peak hours can 
				increase performance. In general off-peak hours are between 
				1:00-6:00am within a geography&#39;s timezone. </li>
				<li class="style1">Transferring files in parallel (or splitting 
				a large file and transferring each chunk in parallel) can be 
				faster if the network bandwidth allows this. </li>
				<li class="style1">To avoid possible interruptions in file 
				transfers and having to restart the transfer of a large file 
				from the beginning, you will want to confirm that your FTP 
				client and the FTP service you are using supports Resume 
				capability. Most do, but some do not. Anonymous Adhoc file 
				transfer (incoming/outgoing folders) do not support FTP resume 
				due to blind drop/get requirements.&nbsp; Named FTP accounts do; 
				however, support the ability to resume.</li>
				<li class="style1">For connections originating within Intel&#39;s 
				internal networks, avoid the use of a Proxy server.&nbsp; If you 
				are required to do this due to your network requirements, then 
				use Intel Proxy Server host server in your FTP Client 
				configuration that is closest to your current location. This 
				should decrease network latency. </li>

<span class="mw-headline">
<h4 class="style1">
<a name="ServerDisconnects">Server disconnects, but transfer still continues 
(ECONNABORTED - Connection Aborted)</a></h4>
<p class="style1">You may be seeing a disconnect from the ftp.intel.com remote 
server and still continue to see your file still transferring.&nbsp; This is 
normal behavior.&nbsp; The remote server is considering your command 
communication channel as idle if you are not using it while your file is 
transferred and after 5 minutes, the remote server will force a disconnect.&nbsp; 
This is not expected to stop your file transfer as a separate &quot;data&quot; 
communication channel is being used to transfer your file and only after it 
completes the transfer will that communication channel disconnect.</p>

				(FTPS).&nbsp; This is an expected known issue with Intel&#39;s VPN

<h4 class="style1"><a name="Unable_to_connect_ftps">Unable to connect

<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">This known issue can be confirmed if you are able to connect 
successfully using regular unsecure FTP.&nbsp; Some FTP client logs show a hang 
after the AUTH TLS/SSL command and some FTP client logs may show an error 
message similar to &quot;GnuTLS error -73: ASN1 parser: Error in TAG.&quot;.&nbsp; If you 
are aware that your connection is being routed through a Checkpoint firewall, 
then is it possible that the firewall requires inspection of the data packets 
and will drop a connection when it cannot inspect the data, such is the case 
when the FTP connection starts the TLS/SSL handshake as part of the FTPS 
protocol.</p>

<p class="style1">The &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; folders do not allow a CD into 
the folder. This is due to permissions that disallow a directory listing.&nbsp; 
To Download or Upload a file into the &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; folder, you must 
be in the Pub folder which is the parent of the &quot;incoming&quot; and &quot;outgoing&quot; 
folders.&nbsp; Once inside the Pub folder, specify the entire folder path 
including the file name and depending on your FTP client software, you may need 
to specify the local file name too.</p>

of what your FTP client software may support:</p>
